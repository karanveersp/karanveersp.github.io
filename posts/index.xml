      <description>Learning python is easier than other languages for many reasons. One of the reasons is the tremendous amount of great, free resources to learn from. So here are some resources I found heplful.
Books  Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Shows how to write useful programs to do all sorts of things with python. Composing Programs - A python oriented take on the legendary SICP book/course. Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Get immersed in the details.</description>

      <description>For the first post, I want to describe the purpose of this blog.
To share and explore the craft of programming by writing simple tutorials and articles. We don&amp;rsquo;t truly master something until we teach it so I want to challenge myself by consolidating and conveying all that I know for others.
I like Python, TypeScript and Go so most of the posts will have something to do them and their ecosystem.</description>
